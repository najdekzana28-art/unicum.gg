 * Vanity URLs for the creators we partner with: `unicum.gg/remi` lands on that
 * creator's own page on the site.
 *
 * They exist for one reason, and it is not tidiness. A stream overlay is video,
 * so nothing on it is ever clickable: the only thing it can do is make a URL
 * memorable enough that a viewer types it from memory later. A path anyone can
 * hold in their head is therefore the whole mechanism, and
 * `/fr/eu/players/Remi_iD` is not one.
 *
 * Each entry carries UTM parameters so the visit is attributable in Umami. A
 * partnership that cannot be measured can only be renewed on a feeling, and the
 * redirect is the one place every arrival passes through, so it is where the
 * attribution belongs rather than on the creator to append by hand.
 *
 * Written out by hand on purpose: a partnership is an agreement with a person,
 * not something derivable from the database. The list stays short and each line
 * is a deliberate act.
