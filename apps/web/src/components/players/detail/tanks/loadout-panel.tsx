 * How this player has set this vehicle up.

 * that name equipment, consumables, directives, crew perks and roles in the
 * reader's own language are stripped before the dictionaries cross the wire
 * (`SERVER_ONLY_NAMESPACES`), so a client component asking for one gets its
 * key back. What it hands down is finished text and finished URLs.
 *
 * The boxes themselves are drawn by `loadout-boxes.tsx`, which is a client
 * component because a tooltip is interaction. That split is load-bearing
 * rather than tidy: rendering the tooltips from here cost the server
 * rendering of everything they wrapped, measured at one box out of
 * forty-seven, the rest appearing only once hydration had run.
 *
 * It reads as the tank page's own build does, because it is the same thing
 * seen from the other side: that page asks what a vehicle CAN mount, this one
 * shows what one player DID.
