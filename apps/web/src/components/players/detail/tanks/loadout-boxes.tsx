/**
 * The boxes a loadout is drawn as, and the only part of it that is a client
 * component.
 *
 * The split is not decoration. Everything that NAMES a thing happens on the
 * server, in `loadout-panel.tsx`, because the catalogues that name equipment
 * and crew perks never cross the wire. Everything that REACTS to a pointer
 * happens here, because a tooltip is interaction.
 *
 * Measured, and this is why the file exists: rendering the Radix tooltips
 * from inside the server component cost the server rendering of everything
 * they wrapped. The panel came back with one box out of forty-seven and five
 * empty crew rows, and the rest appeared only once hydration had run, which
 * is exactly what a reader notices as "it arrives after the page". With the
 * tooltips removed the same panel server-rendered all forty-seven. So the
 * boxes are drawn here, from data the server already resolved, and they
 * render on both sides.
