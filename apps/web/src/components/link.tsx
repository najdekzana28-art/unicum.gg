   * `/tanks/all/specifications`, `/tanks/all/economics`, `/players/onslaught`
   * and sixteen others: measured on a tank page, 2.5 MB of the 3.9 MB it
   * transferred, none of it rendered, all of it competing for the bandwidth the
   * page itself needed.
   *
   * It is not `prefetch={false}`, which the docs offer for the same case,
   * because that makes the footer's own links wait for the server on click. On
   * intent the prefetch still happens, just for the one link a reader reached
   * for. Restoring the default once they do is what the `null` here is: it hands
   * the link back to Next's normal static prefetching.

 * French page would see nothing but links to English ones. Prefixing here means
