 *
 * Not force-mounted. It once was, to keep the links in the served HTML for
 * crawlers, but a force-mounted Radix content loses its `data-state` the moment
 * any menu opens, so several of them stop hiding and stack on screen. The
 * crawlability that bought is now covered by the footer, which links every one
 * of these destinations, so the panel can mount on open the plain Radix way and
 * only the hovered menu ever shows.
 *
 * It renders twice, and that is the only way a phone gets these links at all.
 * A dropdown here is a Radix `NavigationMenu` item, and fumadocs draws every
 * open menu into ONE viewport shared with the burger panel: below `sm` the
 * sections are rendered inside that panel, so opening one asked the viewport to
 * show the section instead of the panel it was already showing. It measured the
 * new content at zero height, the whole menu collapsed, and nothing was
 * reachable. So the dropdown is the desktop half and a collapsible list is the
 * phone's, each hidden where the other belongs.
