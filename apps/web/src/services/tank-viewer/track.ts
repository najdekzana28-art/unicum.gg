 * wide face outwards. In the game it is the other way round, so the count is
 * measuring something else: the 12 are the tip of the guide, not the guide.
 *
 * There is nothing in the client to check this against: its own track ribbon,

 * The path a belt follows: the client's own polygon, joined end to end.

 * rigid links pinned together, so between two pins it is a straight line, and
 * the polygon the client ships is already that line: 71 points around the loop
 * at the median, 88 at the 95th percentile, which puts a corner about every
 * 14 cm, the length of a link.
 *
 * It used to be smoothed with a centripetal Catmull-Rom, on the reasoning that
 * thirty-odd points would make a link snap through a new heading at every
 * corner. The point count was wrong, and so was the consequence. A Catmull-Rom
 * interpolates its points but bulges between them, outwards on a convex turn,
 * which is exactly where a belt wraps a wheel: measured on the E 100, the
 * curve stood **25.7 mm** clear of the client's own polygon at the rear idler,
 * on wheels of 343 to 498 mm radius. That is the gap between the track and the
 * sprocket, and the client never had it.
 *
 * The heading was never the curve's job anyway. `layTrack` lays each link on
 * the chord to the next one rather than on a tangent, so the articulation at a
 * corner comes out of the chord, which is what a rigid link actually does.

/**
 * Lay links along one side's path, the way the game does: a link every
 * link-length from `start`, each turned to follow the path.
 *
 * **A run, not the whole belt.** The game lays a belt as one or two of these:
 * the chassis names a second link model and gives each run its own start, half
 * a pitch apart, so what reads as one belt is two interleaved.
 *
 * A link is modelled with its centre guide on the low side and its shoe on the
 * high side. The guide has to point **into** the loop so it rides between the
 * road wheels, which puts the shoe outwards: against the ground on the bottom
 * run, skywards on the top one. So the link's own up axis faces out of the
 * loop, and the belt turns over correctly at each end.
 *
 * A link is laid on the **chord its own ends span**, not on the tangent under
 * its centre. A link is a rigid bar between two pins, and pins sit a straight
 * line apart, so a chord is what it actually spans. Sitting it on the tangent
 * instead lifts both its ends off the curve, by 25 mm on a wheel as small as an
 * idler, and every joint round that wheel opens a gap you can see through. On
 * the chord the ends land back on the curve and consecutive links overlap by a
 * few millimetres, which is what a real track does at the pin.
 *
 * **And never further than the link is long.** The chord used to run to the
 * next link whatever the link measured, which is the same thing only while the
 * two agree. They usually do, or near enough: 740 of the 990 link models are
 * longer than the step that lays them, which is the overlap at the pin, and
 * there the chord still stops at the step, because that is where the next pin
 * is. **213 are shorter**, and those were laid on a chord they do not span and
 * carried to the middle of it, which is deeper into every turn than their own
 * ends could ever reach. The BT-5's plate is 285 mm on a 507 mm step, so each
 * one sat 84 mm inside a wheel of 408: both idlers came out through the belt
 * and the band read as a polygon thrown round them. Every Christie suspension
 * is in that group, which is what makes it a family rather than one vehicle.
 * Stopping the chord at the plate puts the BT-5 back to 11 mm, the sagitta a
 * rigid plate of that length genuinely has on a wheel that small, and leaves
 * the other 740 exactly where they were.
