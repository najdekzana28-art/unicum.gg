/**
 * Whether a band of the region's players is still playing, recorded daily.
 *
 * The histograms in `./distribution` count accounts per band, which says how
 * many players reached a level and nothing about whether they still log in.
 * This counts who turned up, so the page can answer which band is the most
 * active and whether that is changing.
 *
 * It keeps its own scan rather than riding the histograms' one. The two could
 * share a `MATERIALIZED` CTE, and the 400ms that would save per region per hour
 * is real but not worth what it costs to get: the histogram rows are
 * (metric, bucket, count) and these are (metric, band, twelve counters), so a
 * `UNION ALL` would mean padding one shape into the other and reading a bucket
 * index out of a band column. Nothing cross-reads the two payloads either (one
 * is keyed by hundred-point bucket and the other by band), so there is no
 * subtraction between them that a shared instant would protect.
 *
 * Every counter here is measured BACKWARDS FROM THE READ, which is what makes
 * the series irrecoverable: whether an account was observed, and whether it had
 * played, are both relative to the instant we asked, and we do not keep the
 * `last_seen_at` of a week ago to ask again with. So a day nobody recorded is a
 * day no later run can fill, exactly like `*_server_online`, and this has to be
 * running before the curve it draws can exist. It also rules out a backfill:
 * there is no earlier state to reconstruct one from.
