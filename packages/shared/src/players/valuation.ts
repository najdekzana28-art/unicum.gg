// It used to carry a second figure beside it, a resale estimate modelled on
// grey-market listings. That one is gone and must not come back: selling a
// Wargaming account is against the game's terms of service, so publishing a
// price for one reads as helping that market along, and it priced an account
// mostly on its owner's global rating, which is the player rather than the
// garage. What a garage costs at the official store is the question the store
// itself answers, so it is the one left here.
//
// It is a floor rather than a valuation of the garage, and the reason is in the
// input: `buildPlayerTankRows` keeps a row per vehicle the account has BATTLES
// in (`battles > 0`), because that is what Wargaming publishes. There is no
// endpoint listing what a garage holds, so a tank bought and never driven is
// invisible to us and adds nothing here. The page says so beside the figure.
//
// Pure and client-safe: computed server-side for the API/SDK (so the bot and
// external consumers get it too), and the constants stay tunable in one place.
